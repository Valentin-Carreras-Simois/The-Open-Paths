            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <section>
                <p>Welcome! My name is Cheryl, and I am a dedicated therapist who firmly believes in your potential.

                    I am Chinese but I was born in Canada. My parents are Chinese, but my mom was born in Mauritius and my dad was born in South Africa, so while Roman Catholicism was the main Religion in our household, we also practiced ancestral rituals.
                    
                    I love meeting people from different backgrounds, learning about their cultures, and enjoying all sorts of food. This passion led me to studying culinary management, English language teaching, and then counselling psychology.
                    
                    Living in Brazil and Japan gave me a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and the importance of supportive social connections, working in government taught me the importance of building strong professional connections. These connections helped me discover that my personal strengths can be my professional strengths, that my perceptions shape my reality, and that I am a darn good listener.
                    
                    My approach mainly focuses on uncovering your strengths to help you overcome current challenges. I use mindfulness and externalization techniques to foster self-awareness and resilience. I believe that you have the ability to move yourself closer to the person you want to be.
                    
                    Respecting your autonomy is essential, so I aim to create an environment where you feel empowered to explore and achieve positive changes in your life.</p>
